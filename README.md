## Requirements:
- An API client library should be implemented.
- A programming language that is seen fit should be used.
- The following task should be solved:
    * Search for invalid values (e.g '111111', '12345678')
    * Update users in order to default them to empty string.
    * Report all instances.

### Decisions made prior to implementation:
- Python is to be used as the programming language.
- The project should contain two files:
    - `btac.py` : The library that contains various methods.
    - `main.py` : The driver file which demonstrates usage of the library.
